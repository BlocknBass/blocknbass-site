				<h1>FAQ</h1>
				<h2>1. What is Block & Bass?</h2>
				Block & Bass is our (Edlan, Arne, Froetzoe, Geertiebear, Luconos, Spectrapulse, sjluc, Zilantic and Swagtron) project to create a Drum and Bass festival on a Minecraft server.
				We're much like you bummed out about the recent cancellation of pretty much the entire festival season because of government efforts to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
				In light of this we thought "what better way to help our fellow music enthousiasts combat boredom while they have to stay inside then to give them something with which they can <I>still</I> visit a festival,
				but from home?"
				<h2>2. What version of Minecraft do I need?</h2>
				The server is currently running on a modpack only compatible with Minecraft Java edition version 1.12.2. You will also need to run the installer that we have provided above, 
				which will install all of the correct mods, resource packs and frameworks. You can then set the correct resource pack from within Minecraft's settings menu.
				<h2>3. What are the minimal system requirements to be able to join the server?</h2>
				As you may know, Minecraft is a game that is mostly taxing on your CPU instead of like most other games the GPU. 
				That being said, we do plan on implemeting an array of effects that can put the GPU through its 
				paces as well. So for the time being we recommend
				<ul>
					<li>
						CPU&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Intel i3-6300/AMD Ryzen 3 3300U or higher
					</li>
					<li>
						GPU&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nvidia GTX 1050/AMD RX 560 or higher
					</li>
				</ul>
				Please do keep in mind to have ample space for the installation on your drive. The total package won't be much larger than 3GB, but try to have at least 10GB of space, just to be safe.
				<h2>4. Won't the server get laggy if you run all these mods simultaniously?</h2>
				As of writing this, we haven't yet beta-tested the server, so there's a couple of unknowns when it comes to that. As of right now, the server capacity is kept at a maximum of 250 people.
				We think the server we have right now is more than sufficient to run at that capacity, however, we are planning on making the server infrastructure more robust in the future.
